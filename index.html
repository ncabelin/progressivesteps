          <p>
            Licensed speech-language pathologists trained specifically to meet the communication needs of children ages 0-3 years. A speech-language pathologist will first conduct a complete speech and language assessment to determine a child's level of functioning in the following areas:

            <tr><td>articulation/phonological development</td></tr>
          </table>
          <p>
            Once an assessment has been completed, the speech-language pathologist will develop a treatment plan to address a child's specific speech and language needs.
          </p>
          <h4><strong>Occupational Therapists</strong></h4>
          <p>
          <img src="images/ballpit.jpg" class="img-right rounded" />
          Occupational therapy - a treatment that focuses on helping people achieve independence in all areas of their lives - can provide children with various special needs with positive, fun activities to increase their participation in childhood activities. Occupational therapists use play and other activity to improve a young child's motor, problem solving, and sensory processing skills. They help to improve the skills of young children so that they may take pleasure in the childhood experiences of building with blocks, coloring pictures, sculpting with playdough, digging in the sand, playing ball with friends, and feeding themselves with spoon and fork.
          </p>
          <h4><strong>Physical Therapists</strong></h4>
          <p>
          The role of the physical therapist in early intervention is first to assess the child for the need for physical therapy. The physical therapist will assess gross motor development, strength, range of motion, muscle tone, posture, balance, coordination and quality of movement. Once a need for physical therapy has been determined the therapist will set goals and develop a treatment plan to provide stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination training to improve the gross motor skills of the child. Typical gross motor goals for a child may include rolling, sitting, crawling or walking as well as transitions in and out of different positions. The therapist will use toys, balls, swings and other equipment to make the therapy session fun and effective. The physical therapist will work along with the other members of the child's team and incorporate activities to facilitate growth in other areas of development as well, including fine motor skills, speech and cognition. The family will also be educated in activities to do at home that will provide follow through to the physical therapy program.
          <br /><br />
          Another role of the physical therapist is to determine a need for any equipment or orthotic devices such as walkers, wheelchairs, standing frames or braces to provide support at the ankle. A referral will often be made to an orthopedist to assist with this process and determine other needs in this area.

          <h3>Center-based 'Mommy &amp; Me' Program</h3>
          <p>
            The Progressive Steps center-based program offers a 1:3 therapist/child ratio. <img src="images/center1.jpg" class="img-left rounded"/>
            By providing a low instructional ratio, children with special needs will receive individualized assistance in completing cognitive tasks, language and social skills goals. Children in the program range from 24 months-36 months of age. The Progressive Steps center-based program is offered to children in addition to other individual therapeutic services provided on a 1:1 basis (i.e.: speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, child development).
          </p>
          <p>
            The center-based program offers parents and their children a variety of opportunities to participate in a preschool environment with their peers. Children will learn to transition without difficulty, understand and follow classroom routines, participate in circle time, gross motor play, self help skills, feeding skills, as well as engagement in age appropriate peer interaction. The therapists in the class will provide children with activities that excite and challenge each child based on individual goals. Praise is offered at every opportunity for a task completed to the best of the child's ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parenting topics are discussed during the program to assist families with developmental concerns including appropriate language acquisition, behavior issues, and toilet training.
